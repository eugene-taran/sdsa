# SDSA Demo Video Script (2 minutes)

## Opening (0:00-0:15)
"Are you tired of generic AI coding assistants that don't understand YOUR specific situation? Meet SDSA - Software Development Smart Assist - the first AI mentor that actually gets to know you before giving advice."

## Problem Statement (0:15-0:30)
"Traditional coding assistants give the same generic answers to everyone. But a junior developer learning React needs different guidance than a senior architect scaling microservices. That's why we built SDSA - it uses interactive questionnaires to understand your unique context BEFORE providing personalized recommendations."

## Demo Start - Category Selection (0:30-0:45)
"Let me show you how it works. SDSA organizes learning journeys into categories. Let's say I want to set up end-to-end testing. I select the E2E Testing questionnaire, and instead of jumping straight to generic advice, SDSA asks targeted questions about MY specific situation."

## Questionnaire Flow (0:45-1:00)
"Do I have an existing test system? What framework am I using? What are my testing goals? Each answer shapes the AI's understanding of my needs. I can use text inputs, checkboxes, or radio buttons to provide detailed context."

## The Magic Moment - Gemini Image (1:00-1:15)
"Here's where the magic happens! When I complete the questionnaire, Gemini 2.5 Flash Image Preview generates a personalized visual joke about my learning journey. This isn't just fun - it creates a memorable, encouraging entry point that makes technical learning more engaging."

## Personalized Chat (1:15-1:35)
"Now Gemini 2.5 Flash takes over with streaming chat responses. Watch how it references MY specific answers - it knows I'm using React, need CI/CD integration, and am focused on regression testing. This isn't generic advice - it's personalized mentorship based on MY context."

## Technical Innovation (1:35-1:50)
"SDSA showcases Gemini's dual capabilities: using image generation for engagement and conversational AI for personalized guidance. The streaming responses provide immediate feedback, while maintaining full context throughout our conversation. And if I need to update my answers, the AI instantly adapts its recommendations."

## Closing & Impact (1:50-2:00)
"SDSA transforms how developers learn - from one-size-fits-all to truly personalized AI mentorship. Try it yourself at sdsa.team and experience the future of developer education powered by Gemini."
