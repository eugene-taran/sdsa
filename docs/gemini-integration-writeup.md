# Gemini Integration Writeup

SDSA leverages **Gemini 2.5 Flash Image Preview** and **Gemini 2.5 Flash** to create a revolutionary AI-powered learning experience for developers. The application uniquely combines both models to maximize engagement and utility.

**Gemini 2.5 Flash Image Preview** generates personalized visual jokes when users complete questionnaires, creating an encouraging and memorable entry point to their learning journey. This innovative use of image generation transforms typically dry technical learning into an engaging experience.

**Gemini 2.5 Flash** powers the core chat functionality with **streaming responses** for real-time interaction. The model maintains full context from users' questionnaire answers, enabling highly personalized guidance. Unlike generic coding assistants, SDSA uses structured questionnaires to gather detailed context about users' tech stack, experience level, and specific challenges before providing recommendations.

The integration features:
- **Context-aware streaming chat** that remembers questionnaire responses throughout the conversation
- **Dynamic prompt engineering** based on questionnaire topic and user answers
- **Personalized system prompts** configured per questionnaire for domain expertise
- **Real-time response streaming** for immediate user feedback

This dual-model approach showcases Gemini's versatilityâ€”using image generation for engagement and conversational AI for personalized mentorship, creating a unique learning experience previously impossible with traditional tools.
