A cross-platform application (iOS, Android, Web) that provides personalized AI assistance for software developers through context-aware questionnaires.

üèÜ **[Kaggle Banana Hackathon Submission](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/banana/writeups/sdsa-software-development-smart-assist)** - Building AI-powered developer tools with Gemini

## Overview

SDSA helps to get better answers from AI, based on your project's unique requirements, tech stack, and constraints.

### How It Works

1. **Browse Categories**: Explore questionnaires organized by topics (CI/CD, Testing, Architecture, etc.)
2. **Answer Questions**: Provide context about your specific situation
3. **Get Recommendations**: Receive personalized AI-generated guidance
4. **Chat with Context**: Continue the conversation with full awareness of your answers

## üèÜ Kaggle Banana Hackathon

This project is a submission to the [Kaggle Banana Hackathon](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/banana/writeups/sdsa-software-development-smart-assist), showcasing innovative use of Google's Gemini AI for developer productivity.

### Hackathon Highlights
- **Challenge**: Build creative AI applications using Gemini
- **Our Solution**: Context-aware developer assistant that understands before it assists
- **Key Innovation**: Questionnaire-first approach for personalized AI guidance
- **Tech Stack**: React Native + Expo + Gemini AI

## Features

- üéØ **Context-Aware**: Questionnaires gather specific requirements before providing advice
- üí¨ **Personalized Chat**: AI conversations tailored to your project's context
- üì± **Multi-Platform**: Works on iOS, Android, and Web from a single codebase
- üåê **Offline Ready**: Bundled questionnaires work without internet
- üöÄ **Gemini Powered**: Uses Google's Gemini AI for intelligent responses
- üë• **Open Source**: Community-driven questionnaires and development
- üîê **BYOK Model**: Bring Your Own Key for maximum privacy and control

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20.x (auto-installed via nvm/fnm/asdf)
- Yarn 1.22+ package manager
- iOS Simulator (Mac only) or Android Studio for mobile testing
- Gemini API Key (free tier available)

### API Key Setup

SDSA uses a **BYOK (Bring Your Own Key)** model for maximum security and flexibility.

#### Option 1: In-App Setup (Recommended)

1. **Launch the app**:
   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```

2. **On first launch**, you'll see a welcome screen asking for your API key

3. **Get your free API key**:
   - Click "Get your free API key" link in the app
   - Or visit [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
   - Create a new key (free tier available)

4. **Enter your key** in the app and click "Save & Continue"

Your API key is stored securely on your device using AsyncStorage and never sent to any servers.

#### Option 2: Pre-configure for Development

For development, you can pre-configure your API key:

```bash
# Copy the example environment file
cp .env.example .env.local

# Add your API key (optional)
echo "GEMINI_API_KEY=your-api-key" >> .env.local

# Start the app
yarn start
```

> **üîí Security**: This is a BYOK application where:
> - Each user provides their own API key
> - Keys are stored locally on the device
> - No keys are ever sent to our servers
> - Perfect for open-source and community use

> **Note**: Free tier includes 15 requests/minute and 1M tokens/month - plenty for development and personal use.

### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/eugene-taran/sdsa.git
cd sdsa

# Install correct Node version (if using nvm)
nvm install
nvm use

# Install Yarn (if not installed)
npm install -g yarn

# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Set up your Gemini API key (optional - can also add via UI)
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local and add your API key from https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey

# Start development server
yarn start
```

### Detailed Installation

1. **Install Node.js 20.x using a version manager (recommended):**

```bash
# Using nvm
nvm install
nvm use

# Using fnm
fnm install
fnm use

# Using asdf
asdf install nodejs
```

2. **Install Yarn and dependencies:**

```bash
# Install Yarn globally
npm install -g yarn

# Install project dependencies
yarn install
# or for CI environments
yarn install --frozen-lockfile
```

3. **Start the development server:**

```bash
yarn start
```

### Running the App

#### Web Development

```bash
yarn web
# Or
yarn start --web
```

#### iOS Simulator (Mac only)

```bash
yarn ios
# Or
yarn start --ios
```

#### Android Emulator

```bash
yarn android
# Or
yarn start --android
```

#### Physical Device

1. Install Expo Go app on your device
2. Scan the QR code from the terminal
3. For production features requiring native modules (Rock AI), you'll need a development build

### Development Builds

Since the app uses Rock for on-device AI inference, you'll need development builds for full functionality:

#### iOS Development Build

```bash
yarn dev-client:ios
# Or
yarn build:ios --profile development
```

#### Android Development Build

```bash
yarn dev-client:android
# Or
yarn build:android --profile development
```

- **Dependency Locking**: `yarn.lock` with `yarn install --frozen-lockfile` for reproducible builds
- **Package Manager**: Yarn for faster, more reliable dependency management
- **EAS Build**: Cloud builds for iOS and Android without local setup
- **GitHub Actions Ready**: CI workflow included (currently disabled, rename `.github/workflows/ci.yml.disabled` to enable)

## Security & Privacy

### BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) Model

SDSA prioritizes user privacy and security through a BYOK approach:

- **üîê Your Key, Your Control**: Each user provides their own Gemini API key
- **üì± Local Storage Only**: Keys are stored securely on your device using AsyncStorage
- **üö´ No Server Transmission**: Your API key never leaves your device
- **‚úÖ Open Source Transparency**: All code is open for review

### Why BYOK?

1. **Maximum Privacy**: Your API usage and data stay between you and Google
2. **No Middleman**: Direct communication with Gemini API
3. **Cost Control**: You manage your own API usage and billing
4. **Trust**: No need to trust third-party servers with your keys

### For Deployment

When deploying SDSA:
- **Web/Vercel**: Users enter their own keys through the UI

## Troubleshooting

### Gemini API Key Issues

If AI features are not working:

1. **Verify API key is set**:
   ```bash
   yarn verify  # Check if API key is configured
   ```

2. **Check environment file**:
   ```bash
   # Ensure .env.local exists and contains your key
   cat .env.local | grep GEMINI_API_KEY
   ```

3. **Restart Metro bundler**:
   ```bash
   # Clear cache and restart
   npx expo start -c
   ```

4. **API key limits**:
   - Free tier: 15 requests/minute, 1M tokens/month
   - If you hit limits, wait or upgrade your plan

### Metro bundler issues

```bash
npx expo start -c
```

### iOS build issues

Ensure you have the latest Xcode and iOS simulators installed.

### Android build issues

Ensure Android Studio and Android SDK are properly configured.

- **Solution**: Context-gathering questionnaires that understand before assisting
- **Impact**: More relevant, actionable advice for developers

### Technical Innovation

- **BYOK Model**: Users control their own API keys
- **Cross-Platform**: One codebase for iOS, Android, and Web
- **Offline-First**: Questionnaires bundled for instant access
- **Privacy-First**: No data leaves the user's device
