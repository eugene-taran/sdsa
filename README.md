# SDSA - Software Development Smart Assist

A mobile application that provides guided learning journeys for software developers through interactive questionnaires and on-device AI assistance.

## Overview

SDSA uses context-gathering questionnaires organized in categories to understand users' specific situations before providing personalized AI-powered recommendations. Unlike traditional coding assistants, it builds context through targeted questions before offering guidance.

## Features

- ðŸš€ **Interactive Questionnaires**: Answer targeted questions to build context
- ðŸ¤– **On-Device AI**: Privacy-preserving assistance with offline capabilities
- ðŸ“š **Community-Driven Content**: Open-source questionnaire repository
- ðŸ’¬ **Contextual Chat**: AI chat that understands your entire learning journey
- ðŸ”’ **Privacy-First**: Free tier runs entirely on-device

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20.x (auto-installed via nvm/fnm/asdf)
- Yarn 1.22+ package manager
- iOS Simulator (Mac only) or Android Studio for mobile testing

### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/eugene-taran/sdsa
cd sdsa

# Install correct Node version (if using nvm)
nvm install
nvm use

# Install Yarn (if not installed)
npm install -g yarn

# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Start development server
yarn start
```

### Detailed Installation

1. **Install Node.js 20.x using a version manager (recommended):**

```bash
# Using nvm
nvm install
nvm use

# Using fnm
fnm install
fnm use

# Using asdf
asdf install nodejs
```

2. **Install Yarn and dependencies:**

```bash
# Install Yarn globally
npm install -g yarn

# Install project dependencies
yarn install
# or for CI environments
yarn install --frozen-lockfile
```

3. **Start the development server:**

```bash
yarn start
```

### Running the App

#### Web Development

```bash
yarn web
# Or
yarn start --web
```

#### iOS Simulator (Mac only)

```bash
yarn ios
# Or
yarn start --ios
```

#### Android Emulator

```bash
yarn android
# Or
yarn start --android
```

#### Physical Device

1. Install Expo Go app on your device
2. Scan the QR code from the terminal
3. For production features requiring native modules (Rock AI), you'll need a development build

### Development Builds

Since the app uses Rock for on-device AI inference, you'll need development builds for full functionality:

#### iOS Development Build

```bash
yarn dev-client:ios
# Or
yarn build:ios --profile development
```

#### Android Development Build

```bash
yarn dev-client:android
# Or
yarn build:android --profile development
```

## CI/CD Ready

This project is configured to work on clean CI environments:

- **Node Version Management**: `.nvmrc` and `.node-version` files ensure consistent Node.js version
- **Dependency Locking**: `yarn.lock` with `yarn install --frozen-lockfile` for reproducible builds
- **Package Manager**: Yarn for faster, more reliable dependency management
- **EAS Build**: Cloud builds for iOS and Android without local setup
- **GitHub Actions Ready**: CI workflow included (currently disabled, rename `.github/workflows/ci.yml.disabled` to enable)

## Troubleshooting

### Metro bundler issues

```bash
npx expo start -c
```

### iOS build issues
